OWNER/OPERATOR = ENLOE MEDICAL CENTER DBA. photo.While returning from an inter-facility transfer from Sacramento to Chico California, at 0159 in the morning, the helicopter struck a goose on the left side windscreen (pilot side) at eye level. The bird shattered the top-half of the windscreen striking the PIC in the head then striking the flight medic behind him in the face shield of his helmet before finally lodging between the backseat and the rear bulkhead. The aircraft was in cruise flight at 1200ft MSL traveling at approx. 130 KIAS. The pilot and crew were flying under night vision goggles. The pilot and did not see the bird prior to impact. The nurse seated in the right rear and under goggles, saw the bird from right to left just before it impacted the pilot windscreen. There was no time for warning. After impact the PIC reduced speed to 55-60 KIAS. The flight nurse made immediate contact with MedComm to activate the program's Post Accident/ Incident plan. During this, the medic activated the emergency switch on the Honeywell flight tracker. Once the speed was reduced, the PIC tried to clear his NVG's from his vision as they were broken and suspended in front of his face. The crew immediately check to see if the PIC was okay since he took the brunt of the goose impact to his face and head. It took a minute for him to respond in the affirmative since his microphone had been knocked back and away. Once the crew determined that everyone was OK, the medic cut away the cord that held the suspended NVG's. The PIC assessed the aircraft condition and flight controls and felt no abnormalities or unusual vibration.  As the team discussed their options, the flight nurse offered to trade helmets with the PIC since he still had functioning NVG's. The PIC decided against the change and all agreed it would safer to continue the flight to Oroville airport (KOVE) and land in a well-lit, familiar area. The flight nurse continued to update the Comm Center for the next several minutes of the flight. The aircraft landed at KOVE without further incident. After the shutdown, the pilot was treated for several minor cuts to the face from plexi glass. A walk around revealed a second bird had struck the right horizontal stabilizer. A 3-inch crack was also discovered on the pilots door window. There were no serious injuries and the team decided a safety stand down would commence for the duration of the shift.
